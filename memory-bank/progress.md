# Progress: Scopa Trainer

## What Works

### Core Game Mechanics
- ✅ Full Scopa rule implementation
- ✅ Card dealing and turn management
- ✅ Capture logic with combination detection
- ✅ Score calculation (scopa points, card counts, etc.)
- ✅ Game flow from start to completion

### User Interface
- ✅ Responsive card layout with proper styling
- ✅ Card selection and capture highlighting
- ✅ Turn indicators and player feedback
- ✅ Score display during gameplay
- ✅ Game controls (new game, help)

### AI Implementation
- ✅ Strategic AI decision making with priorities
- ✅ AI move execution with visual feedback
- ✅ No "cheating" - AI only uses visible information

### Post-Game Analysis
- ✅ Detailed move-by-move analysis
- ✅ Move quality evaluation (good, mediocre, bad)
- ✅ AI alternative move suggestions
- ✅ Interactive replay interface
- ✅ Strategic tips based on gameplay patterns

## What's Left to Build

### Enhancements
- [ ] Local storage implementation for game persistence
- [ ] Multiple difficulty levels for AI
- [ ] Statistics tracking across multiple games
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Mobile-specific optimizations

### Technical Improvements
- ✅ Code refactoring for better maintainability
  - Implemented MVC architecture
  - Separated JavaScript into modular files
  - Used ES6 modules with import/export
- [ ] Unit tests for game logic
- [ ] Better error handling

## Current Status
- **Overall:** Functional implementation with core features complete and code architecture improved
- **Stage:** Code architecture refinement complete; ready for feature enhancements
- **Priority:** Next steps include implementing local storage for game persistence and enhancing AI difficulty levels

## Known Issues
- AI decision making could be more sophisticated for advanced strategies
- No formal accessibility features implemented
- Game state not persisted between sessions
