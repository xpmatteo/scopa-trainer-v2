# Progress: Scopa Trainer

## What Works

### Core Game Mechanics
- ✅ Full Scopa rule implementation
- ✅ Card dealing and turn management
- ✅ Capture logic with combination detection
- ✅ Score calculation (scopa points, card counts, etc.)
- ✅ Game flow from start to completion

### User Interface
- ✅ Responsive card layout with proper styling
- ✅ Card selection and capture highlighting
- ✅ Turn indicators and player feedback
- ✅ Score display during gameplay
- ✅ Game controls (new game, help)

### AI Implementation
