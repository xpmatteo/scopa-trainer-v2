# Project Brief: Scopa Trainer

## Project Purpose
Create a browser-based implementation of the Scopa card game (two-player variant) that allows a human player to play against an AI opponent and receive post-game analysis to improve their skills.

### Game Mechanics
- Implementation of Italian Scopa card game rules (2-player)
- Traditional 40-card Italian deck (Coppe, Denari, Bastoni, Spade)
- Proper card ranking and scoring system
- Turn-based gameplay with clear state management

### AI Components
- Intelligent AI opponent using minimax algorithm
- No cheating (AI cannot see hidden cards)
- Post-game analysis with move quality evaluation
- Turn-by-turn feedback on player decisions

### User Experience
- Intuitive card selection and gameplay
- Clear visual indication of game state
- No computer assistance identifying captures
- Interactive review of key decision points after game

## Key Constraints
- Browser-based implementation
- Local storage for game state
- No backend server dependencies
