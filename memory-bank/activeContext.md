# Active Context: Scopa Trainer

## Current Work Focus
- Modular code architecture implementation
- Separation of concerns with MVC pattern
- Memory Bank maintenance

## Recent Changes
- Created core Memory Bank files:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Technical Context
- Refactored code architecture from monolithic to modular:
  - Separated JavaScript from HTML file
  - Implemented Model-View-Controller pattern
  - Created module-based imports

## Current Implementation Status
- An initial implementation exists in `web/scopa-enhanced.html`
- The implementation includes:
  - Complete game rules and mechanics
  - AI opponent with strategic decision making
  - Interactive UI with card selection
  - Post-game analysis features
  - Move replay system

## Active Decisions
- Organizing project documentation via Memory Bank
- Determining next steps for feature enhancements or improvements

## Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete Memory Bank initialization with progress.md
2. ✅ Create .clinerules file to capture project-specific patterns
3. ✅ Analyze the current implementation for potential improvements
4. ✅ Refactor codebase to MVC architecture for better maintainability
5. Implement local storage for game state persistence
6. Develop multiple AI difficulty levels
7. Add statistics tracking across games
8. Implement accessibility improvements
9. Optimize mobile experience

## Open Questions
- Should the game state be persisted between browser sessions?
- Are there accessibility improvements that should be prioritized?
- Is the current AI difficulty level appropriate for the target users?
- How might we extend the tutorial/help functionality?
