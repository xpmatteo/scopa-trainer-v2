# Active Context: Scopa Trainer

## Current Work Focus
- Modular code architecture implementation
- Separation of concerns with MVC pattern
- AI capabilities improvement and isolation as a pure function
- Memory Bank maintenance

## Recent Changes
- Created core Memory Bank files:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Technical Context
- Refactored code architecture from monolithic to modular:
  - Separated JavaScript from HTML file
  - Implemented Model-View-Controller pattern
  - Created module-based imports
- Implemented centralized legal moves functionality:
  - Created `findAllLegalMoves` function for unified move validation
  - Refactored AI decision-making to use this function
  - Updated controller to use legal moves for player interactions
  - Eliminated duplicate logic across the codebase
- Separated AI into a pure function module:
  - Created dedicated ai.js module with no direct access to global state
  - Refactored AI to accept only the information it can "see"
  - Improved architecture with clear separation between model and AI
  - Made AI testable and modular with pure function approach

## Current Implementation Status
- Current implementation includes:
  - Complete game rules and mechanics
  - AI opponent with strategic decision making as a pure function
  - Interactive UI with card selection
  - Post-game analysis features
  - Move replay system
  - Unified legal moves validation system

## Active Decisions
- Using centralized legal moves system for all move validation
- Maintaining consistent rule enforcement throughout the codebase
- Separating AI from global state for better modularity
- Preparing for future AI improvements with a testable foundation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete Memory Bank initialization with progress.md
2. ✅ Create .clinerules file to capture project-specific patterns
3. ✅ Analyze the current implementation for potential improvements
4. ✅ Refactor codebase to MVC architecture for better maintainability
5. ✅ Implement centralized legal moves functionality
6. ✅ Refactor controller and model to use the legal moves system
7. ✅ Separate AI into a pure function module
8. Implement local storage for game state persistence
9. Develop multiple AI difficulty levels (now simplified with the new AI module)
10. Add statistics tracking across games
11. Implement accessibility improvements
12. Optimize mobile experience

## Open Questions
- What additional AI improvements can be built on top of the pure function system?
- Should the game state be persisted between browser sessions?
- Are there accessibility improvements that should be prioritized?
- Is the current AI difficulty level appropriate for the target users?
- How might we extend the tutorial/help functionality?
