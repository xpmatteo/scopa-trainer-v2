# Active Context: Scopa Trainer

## Current Work Focus
- Documentation setup phase
- Memory Bank initialization
- Understanding the existing implementation

## Recent Changes
- Created core Memory Bank files:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Technical Context

## Current Implementation Status
- An initial implementation exists in `web/scopa-enhanced.html`
- The implementation includes:
  - Complete game rules and mechanics
  - AI opponent with strategic decision making
  - Interactive UI with card selection
  - Post-game analysis features
  - Move replay system

## Active Decisions
- Organizing project documentation via Memory Bank
- Determining next steps for feature enhancements or improvements

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank initialization with progress.md
2. Create .clinerules file to capture project-specific patterns
3. Analyze the current implementation for potential improvements
4. Consider enhancements to the AI strategy or analysis engine
5. Review the user experience for optimization opportunities

## Open Questions
- Should the game state be persisted between browser sessions?
- Are there accessibility improvements that should be prioritized?
- Is the current AI difficulty level appropriate for the target users?
- How might we extend the tutorial/help functionality?
