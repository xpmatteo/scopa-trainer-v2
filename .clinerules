# Scopa Trainer Project Rules

## Code Style Preferences
- HTML file containing CSS with separate JavaScript modules
- ES6+ JavaScript module system with imports/exports
- ES6+ JavaScript constructs preferred
- CSS uses flexbox for responsive layouts
- Semantic variable naming (descriptive rather than abbreviated)

## Project Structure
- MVC architecture with clear separation of concerns:
  - model.js: Game state and business logic
  - controller.js: UI handling and DOM manipulation
  - main.js: Application initialization and event binding
- Organize JavaScript functions into logical groups by responsibility:
  - Game initialization and state management
  - Card manipulation and game mechanics
  - Player interaction and event handling
  - AI logic and decision making
  - Analysis features and game evaluation

## Implementation Patterns
- Use central gameState object to manage all state
- Render UI elements based on state changes
- DOM manipulation follows declarative pattern
- AI uses priority-based decision making
- Game analysis tracks each move for post-game review

## Card Representation
- Cards represented as objects: `{suit: string, value: number, id: string}`
- Suits: 'coins', 'cups', 'swords', 'clubs'
- Values: 1-10 (1=Asso, 8=Fante, 9=Cavallo, 10=Re)
- ID format: `${suit}-${value}`

## Game Flow Patterns
- Turn-based model: Player action -> AI response
- Move sequence: Select hand card -> Select table card(s) -> Confirm move
- Game divided into rounds of dealing until deck exhausted
- Post-game analysis occurs after final scoring

## Naming Conventions
- Element IDs use kebab-case: 'player-score', 'ai-hand', etc.
- JavaScript variables use camelCase: 'playerHand', 'tableCards', etc.
- CSS classes use descriptive names for card states: 'selected', 'highlight-card'

## UI Interaction Models
- Cards highlight on hover
- Selected cards have yellow border
- AI actions have visual indication (temporary card display)
- Error messages displayed in central message area
- Modal dialogs for game completion and analysis
